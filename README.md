# Media_Survival_Analysis
I worked on analyzing the performance of a newspaper company Bharat herald. The aim was to understand the challenges the company faced in recent years and suggest ways they can improve.

# Problem Statement
Bharat Herald, a legacy newspaper organization with operations across five Indian states, is facing an existential crisis.
With a reputation built over seven decades for multilingual reporting and sharp regional journalism, the company once printed over 1.2 million copies daily.
But between 2019 and 2024, print circulation has dropped to under 560,000. The pandemic accelerated a shift toward digital news consumption, and competitors like DigiHindi Post, NewsZilla, and InShorts quickly adapted with mobile-first platforms, WhatsApp delivery
models, and subscription bundles.
Meanwhile, Bharat Herald‚Äôs 2021 e-paper pilot failed due to poor mobile usability and was eventually shelved after financial losses.
The result: advertiser confidence declined, vendor payments delayed, and multiple city bureaus shut down.
Over 60 employees across editorial and sales functions have been let go. A recent internal audit flagged severe fiscal concerns.
